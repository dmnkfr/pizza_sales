# Pizza Sales
A case study for Annalect/BMG


### Task 1: Pizza Sales EDA & modeling

__Description__				
				
Imagine that we are trying to explain the sale of frozen pizzas for a given brand in Sweden.				
The response variable will be the total sales in pieces across a number of 				
different pizza types for the respective advertiser. 				
Load data into R and solve the below tasks.				
				
The model is a dummy example and does not reflect real customer data.				
				
__Tasks__				
1. Make a plot for KPI, price offer, calendar variables, weather variables, own campaigns and competitors with their weekly development split by the different types there exist				
2. Make a table that calculates the min, max and total input per data string				
3. Test the data from the data section in the model				
4. Explain which variables you have put into the model and why you chose these				
				
You will not be evaluated on building the model with the highest 				
explanatory power, but your thoughts behind it and the way you handle it in R.			


### Task 2: Game simulator
Solve this task in R - There are 2 boxes - one contains 2$, the other one is empty. You have to pick one of them. If you pick non empty one, you get the value of that box. If you pick an empty one, boxes are randomly re-organized and the value of non-empty box is doubled. This goes on until you pick non empty box.				
				
1. Simulate this game as a function in R. 		
2. Run simulation multiple times (ex. 100K) and calculate summary statistics like median, average, etc.
